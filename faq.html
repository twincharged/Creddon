            <strong>tl;dr</strong>
            Through Creddon you can make a $1-donation to a good cause simply by tweeting a photo. A sponsor will pay the donation, in return for being featured in the photo together with the good-cause organization. All you need to do is tweet. <strong>/tl;dr</strong>

            Creddon is a service where people support good causes by tweeting branded photos, that make sponsors donate $1 to the good-cause organization. For now, Creddon is only available for Twitter, but more social networks will be added in the future. Sponsors pledge to donate $1 per tweet up to a certain amount and then people make those donations happen by tweeting. Each tweet also raises awareness for the good-cause organization.
            </br>
            </br>
            Creddon was launched at <a href="http://www.up.co/communities/usa/east-bay/startup-weekend/5531">Startup Weekend East Bay</a> on April 24-26. We won the competition with this website and $400 committed from four different sponsors: (<a href="http://bebo.com">Bebo</a>, <a href="http://careerdean.com">CareerDean</a>, <a href="http://startuphouse.com">StartupHouse</a> and <a href="http://trackduck.com">TrackDuck</a>) to four different good-cause organizations (<a href="http://handup.org">Hand Up</a>, <a href="http://zip.kiva.org">Kiva Zip</a>, <a href="http://water.org">Water.org</a> and <a href="http://wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a>).
            </br>
            </br>
            Learning about the earthquake in Nepal after leaving the Startup Weekend-bubble, we wanted to find a sponsor for relief in Nepal and continue working on Creddon to activate the remaining donations. We signed up <a href="http://www.rhsfinancial.com//">RHS Financial</a> to sponsor $100 in donations to <a href="https://www.ifrc.org/en/">Nepal Red Cross Society</a>. Unfortunately, most of us in the Startup Weekend team had to go back to reality and tend to studies and work, and since we don't have a marketing budget, we rely on word of mouth from ourselves and the people who like us to tweet out the remaining donations.
            </br>
            </br>
            We are working on a new version of the website which will allow users to upload and tweet their own photos, to make it more personal. We are making a website, because it is faster to develop than mobile apps, but rest assured that after this redesign the next step is to develop the apps so that people can use Creddon whenever and wherever they feel like sharing a meaningful photo and support a cause.
            </br>
            </br>
            Creddon's founder had been interested in microdonations, microloans and crowdfunding for a couple of years and he came to San Francisco to write his Master's thesis at <a href="http://zip.kiva.org//">Kiva Zip</a>, a pilot program at crowdfunding pioneer <a href="http://kiva.org">Kiva</a>. When he learned about Johnson & Johnson's app <a href="http://www.donateaphoto.com//">Donate a Photo</a>, it inspired him to attempt building a platform for <em>philantropic social media marketing</em> where companies, big and small, can invest a sliver of their marketing budgets for brand building and organic advertising, while feeling good that they are simultaneously contributing to good causes.

              <h2>FAQ</h2>
              <ol>
                <li><strong>What is Creddon?</strong></li>
                <p>For <em>users</em>, Creddon is an easy way to do good and support causes you care about. Soon, when we release the next website version that enables you to upload your own photos, it will also be a personal way to do good. For <em>beneficiaries</em>, Creddon is a service that provides free marketing and funds. For <em>sponsors</em>, Creddon is a service for philantropic social media marketing.</p>
                <li><strong>Do you have an app for this?</strong></li>
                <p>Not yet, but we will develop iOS and Android apps. Sign up <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1ZQhcMlpsq_7brLCoyYWs0JxU2pdgoVa354PaZcNmtt4/viewform?usp=send_form">here</a> to be notified when they are published.</p>
                <li><strong>What does the name Creddon mean?</strong></li>
                <p>Creddon comes from "Cred" and "Donation". Give cred to the beneficiary, sponsor, and perhaps a friend in the photo caption. Trigger a donation made by the sponsor.</p>
                <li><strong>How does it work?</strong></li>
                <p>We contact sponsors and agree with them which good-cause organization(s) they want to support and the donation cap. We publish their campaign and monitor how many tweets are made. After each month we report to the sponsor how much they should donate and they give us a copy of the receipt. Creddon currently does not handle any donation money at all, although we may enable users to pay for donations themselves in the future as well as handle sponsors' donations if it makes sense from an administrative perspective. We provide the photo sharing service and build the user base.</p>
                <li><strong>How do I know this is real?</strong></li>
                <p>Below you can see videos from Startup Weekend with Creddon's founder pitching and the judges announcing Creddon as the winner:</p>
                <iframe width="320" height="180" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/02ykP7Qec6c?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                <iframe width="320" height="240" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RfGNOlwzMpc?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>You can also contact the founder on fredrik[at]creddon.com or through the LinkedIn and Twitter links in the Team section.</p>
                <li><strong>When will sponsors make the donation?</strong></li>
                <p>Sponsors make donations based on our reports and we anticipate this happening at a monthly frequency when we are properly up and running. It makes sense to batch payments to reduce transaction costs. For the first batch of sponsors we will make a judgement from case to case when it is appropriate to ask them to make the donation. 
                <li><strong>How will I know if sponsors made the donation?</strong></li>
                <p>Creddon will publish donation receipts (e.g. in the form of a screenshot or photo of a paper receipt) when donations have been made.
                <li><strong>Which tweets count toward donations?</strong></li>
                <p>On the current website we count retweets of the donation photos that @GiveCreddon tweeted originally and that we then embedded on <a href="http://creddon.com//">creddon.com</a>.</p>
                <li><strong>Why are you doing this?</strong></li>
                <p>You can see our mission statement to the left (or above, on mobile). We want to contribute to a positive change in the world and supporting good-cause organizations is one way of doing that.
